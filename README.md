# HIERO-NT

## Introduction
HIERO-NT is an upcoming partial translation of the New Testament from Greek into English. For more information, see [HIERO](http://gfassero.github.io/HIERO/), the Old Testament parallel project.

You can browse the beginnings of [HIERO-NT here](http://gfassero.github.io/HIERO-NT/read/).

## Sources
HIERO-NT depends on the “[Translators Amalgamated Greek NT](http://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data/tree/master/Translators%20Amalgamated%20OT%2BNT)” (TAGNT) by [STEP Bible](http://www.stepbible.org/), licensed under [CC BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). TAGNT provides the Greek text from which HIERO-NT works, as well as lexical and grammatical tags on which HIERO-NT’s Greek parsing dictionary is primarily based.

HIERO-NT also uses some data from the “[Translators Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Greek](http://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data/blob/master/Lexicons/TBESG%20-%20Translators%20Brief%20lexicon%20of%20Extended%20Strongs%20for%20Greek%20-%20STEPBible.org%20CC%20BY.txt)” (TBESG) by [STEP Bible](http://www.stepbible.org/) is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). TBESG contains part-of-speech mappings and Strongs number mappings that are used in HIERO-NT’s English lexicon.

“[Rahlfs' LXX edition 1935 with features](http://github.com/CenterBLC/LXX/tree/main/tf/1935)” by the [Center of Biblical Languages and Computing](http://github.com/CenterBLC) is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/license/mit). RLXX1935/CBLC provides most of the Septuagint text from which HIERO-NT works, as well as some lexical and grammatical tags on which HIERO-NT’s Greek parsing dictionary is partially based.
