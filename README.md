# HIERO-NT

## Introduction
HIERO-NT is an upcoming partial translation of the New Testament from Greek into English. For more information, see [HIERO](http://gfassero.github.io/HIERO/), the Old Testament sister project.

You can browse the beginnings of [HIERO-NT here](http://gfassero.github.io/HIERO-NT/read/).

## Sources
HIERO depends on the “[Translators Amalgamated Greek NT](http://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data/tree/master/Translators%20Amalgamated%20OT%2BNT)” (TAGNT) by [STEP Bible](http://www.stepbible.org/), licensed under [CC BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). TAGNT provides the Greek text from which HIERO-NT works, as well as lexical and grammatical tags on which HIERO-NT’s Greek parsing dictionary is primarily based.

HIERO also uses data from “[Strong’s Dictionary in XML](http://github.com/morphgnt/strongs-dictionary-xml)” by [Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen](http://github.com/emg), released into the public domain under [CC0 1.0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
